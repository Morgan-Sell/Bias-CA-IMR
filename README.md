## Table of Contents

## Description
Uncovered statistical evidence to support that Titanic ethos of "women and children first", which aspiring data scientists know well, continues in the California healthcare system. By applying Bayesian inference and frequentist methods, one can conclude with a high level of certainty (98% CI) that arbitrators are more likely to overturn denial of insurance coverage of medical and health procedures for children (\leq 10 years) that patients of other ages. 

## Data
The data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC). It is comprised of more than 28,000 Independent Medical Reviews(IMR) of patients' appeals to their insurances' denial of coverage of medical treatment and/or healthcare service. The IMRs were administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. If an IMR decided in a patient's favor, i.e. overturned the decision, the insurer was obligated to authorize the requested service or treatment.

The dataset has a total of 14 features - numeric, categorical, and free form. Examples of features include patient age/gender, diagnosis and treatment categories and subcategories, and arbitrator' findings.
