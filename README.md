## Description
Uncovered statistical evidence to support that Titanic ethos of "women and children first", which aspiring data scientists know well, continues in the California healthcare system. By applying Bayesian inference and frequentist methods, one can conclude with a high level of certainty (98% CI) that arbitrators are more likely to overturn denial of insurance coverage of medical and health procedures for children (10 years or older) than patients of other ages.

## Data
The data is from the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC). It is comprised of more than 28,000 Independent Medical Reviews(IMR) of patients' appeals to their insurances' denial of coverage of medical treatment and/or healthcare service. The IMRs were administered by the DMHC since January 1, 2001. If an IMR decided in a patient's favor, i.e. overturned the decision, the insurer was obligated to authorize the requested service or treatment.

The dataset has a total of 14 features - numeric, categorical, and free form. Examples of features include patient age/gender, diagnosis and treatment categories and subcategories, and arbitrator' findings.

# Why does this matter?
People should ask themselves if they are fine with such a bias in determining what is claimed to be an independent, scientific method. Assuming subjectivity is a significant contributor to the outcome of IMRs, it would not be a stretch that other proclaimed objective evaluations are comprised of some degree of partiality.

My intention is not to say that biases should not exist; however, I believe that the public should admit that partiality is real and account for it when making decisions, especially those judgements that apply to a public domain.
